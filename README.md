# Custom Word Embeddings

## Introduction
The Jupyter Notebook `custom_embeddings.ipynb` is dedicated to demonstrating the process of generating custom word embeddings using a simple neural network. This notebook covers tokenization, one-hot encoding, and building a neural network for the task of embedding generation. It is an ideal resource for learners interested in natural language processing and word embeddings.

## Installation
To run this notebook, ensure you have Jupyter and the necessary Python libraries installed, including `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `re`. Install Jupyter using pip:
```bash
pip install notebook
```
Then, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the directory containing `custom_embeddings.ipynb`.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `custom_embeddings.ipynb` from the Jupyter Notebook interface and run the cells sequentially.

## Features
- Tokenization of text data.
- Implementation of one-hot encoding for word representation.
- Construction and training of a basic neural network to generate word embeddings.
- Visualization of the training process.
- Extraction of word embeddings for specific words.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome, especially in areas such as improving the neural network model, optimizing the code, or extending the functionality to include more complex scenarios.
